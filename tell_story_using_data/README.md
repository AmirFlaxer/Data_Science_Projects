1  Project description

We have decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so we decide to try to attract investors. Theyâ€™re interested in the current market conditions - will we be able to maintain our success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off?

As an analytics, we have to prepare some market research. we have open-source data on restaurants in LA.

The tasks are:

    Download the data and prepare it for analysis

    Data analysis

    Preparing a presentation
