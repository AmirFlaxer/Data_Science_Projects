Project description

You are an analyst at a big online store. Together with the marketing department, you've compiled a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue.

    part 1 You need to prioritize these hypotheses
    part 2 launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.

The Project Goal First is the goal to help boost revenue. From the marketing point of view, changes must be analyzed before taking place. There are list of hypotheses and we have to prioritize them. Only the hypotheses with the highest score could be checked.

The second part is about the results analyzing A/B test and checking hypotheses about two statistics. the goal is to determine if the rest can stop or to be continued and what are the outcome.
